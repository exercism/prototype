  %p Hi #{@user.handle},

  %p We thought you might be interested in two improvements to the mentoring tools on Exercism.

  %ol
    %li 
      %strong Embedded mentor notes:
      Over the last two months, dozens of volunteers have been writing notes on how best to mentor each exercise. We have now embedded those into the site, so next time you're mentoring a solution, click the button at the top right of the page labeled "View community mentor notes" to get pointers on what to look out for while giving feedback. We hope this will make mentoring a little easier and faster, especially on exercises that are new to you.
    %li 
      %strong Your mentor rating:
      When people complete a solution, they are given the option to rate the mentoring they have received. Once your mentoring has been rated at least five times, you can now see your average mentor rating on your dashboard.

  %p To check out both new features, visit #{link_to "your Mentoring Dashboard", mentor_dashboard_url}.

  %p Since we launched mentoring in July we've helped over 9,500 people - a phenomenal achievement, made possible by people like you choosing to give back to others. We look forward to seeing you back on the site soon!
  %p Thanks for being a part of the Exercism journey.
