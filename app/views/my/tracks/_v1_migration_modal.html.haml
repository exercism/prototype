  %h3 on the #{track.title} Track

  %p Hello! We've migrated your progress on the #{track.title} Track onto the new Exercism website.
  %p Tracks on the new website can be completed in normalÂ mode where you receive mentor feedback on your solutions, and independent mode - where you work by yourself and request feeback if you get stuck. We highly recommend normal mode, but the choice is yours!
