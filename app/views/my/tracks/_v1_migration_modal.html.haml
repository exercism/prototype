    %p Hello! We've migrated your progress on the #{track.title} Track onto the new Exercism website.
    %p Tracks on the new website can be completed in Mentored Mode where you receive mentor feedback on your solutions, and Practice Mode - where you work by yourself and request feedback if you get stuck.

      This track is currently
      =link_to "oversubscribed", "https://exercism.io/blog/oversubscribed-tracks", target: "_blank"
      and only available in Practice Mode. Practice Mode let's you work through exercises at your own pace, exploring whichever concepts and challenges seem interesting, but won't have human mentors.
    %p You can use Practice Mode today and switch to Mentored Mode when it is accepting more students if you want mentoring.
