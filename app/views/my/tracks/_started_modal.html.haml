  %h2 What is Independent Mode?
  %h3 on the #{track.title} Track
  %p In Independent Mode all of the exercises within a Track are unlocked and students can work through them freely. Note that in this mode Mentor feedback is disabled. This mode is for people who want to do fast deep-dives into a track and is not recommended for those that want the full Exercism experience.
