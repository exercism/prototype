  %h2 Introducing Exercism Research ðŸŽ‰
  %p 
    Over the last few months we've been working on building 
    %strong Exercism Research 
    \- a new part of Exercism where we work with leading researchers to help evolve our collective knowledge about programming. 
  %p Our first experiment explores how people think differently based on the programming languages they know, and how we use that understanding to improve the way we teach new languages.
  %p 
    Please help us by 
    %strong solving some 15-minute challenges 
    in a variety of languages!
