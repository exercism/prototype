        %h2 How Teams Edition works
        %p Exercism is the home of code practice and mentorship. Teams Edition has the same concept and exercises as our Personal Edition, but rather than learning from our mentors, you can learn from your friends, colleagues or bootcamp instructors.

          %h3 1. Choose a language to master
          %p Object oriented, functional, popular, emerging, or just plain obscure. Chat to your team and work out which of our #{num_tracks} different languages you want to explore first.

          %h3 2. Complete a coding challenge on your computer
          %p All the coding happens on your machine in an environment you're familiar with. Download the template, solve the problem, and then upload your solution for your team to see.

          %h3 3. Upload your solution and review it with a friend, colleague or instructor
          %p Discussing code is one of the best ways to learn. Explore ideas with those who have a little more experience or a different point of view.
