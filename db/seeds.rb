  content: "I loved the Ruby track (it is the only one I have finished so far). Solving over 80 different problems seems one of the most exciting ways to learn a language one barely knows. Improving my own solutions for readability and beauty rather than just passing the tests and performance taught me a little about Ruby and programming in general. I also liked comparing my solution to other ones - I could see the problem from other points of view.",

I've been doing the MIPS track and not only do I feel like I am really increasing my level of insight into the inner workings of the machine, I'm having a ton of fun doing it. Thank you so much to everyone who is putting work into this.",

I learned so much by osmosis just from reading.",

  content: "Exercism is fantastic in learning new languages but that is not the extent of it. If you are a \"more experienced\" programmer you may have encountered impostor syndrome: the idea you don't really know what you think you know. Exercism lets you solve problems and put them in the space of open feedback which is a tremendous learning opportunity to explore the depth of your own knowledge. Even if you have been programming in a language for awhile it is worth checking into Exercism to see where you stand with current implementation practices.",
