Great feedback. Thank you.

So I was split between two ways of doing this.
1) Either method pairs with adjectives (which I did),
2) Some sort of data structure (e.g. a hash might look like)

```
{
->{text.to_s.empty?} => 'Fine. Be that way.',
->{text.upcase == text} => "Woah, chill out!",
->{text.end_with?("?")} => "Sure."
}
```

The main reason for the structure would be to link the response to the tone more clearly, which I entirely agree is unclear with the first option. However, I think the hash is just too ugly, and it seemed to be getting overkill to make a whole new structure, or a multi-dimensional array. I also don't think this idea scales for more complex methods.

A better option might be to have the "respond_to_silent" method, do a check and respond, then return true/false. This would link them better. However, I like the ability have separation between what counts as shouting, and how to respond, for single responsibility of methods.

Splitting the pairs into classes would work well (Shout/Silent/Asking classes with a checker/responder). Feels again a little overkill though.

Very happy to hear any suggestions :)
